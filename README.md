## Description

This repository contains examples of bots build using [DFF](https://github.com/deeppavlov/dialog_flow_framework)
(Dialog Flow Framework).

The Dialog Flow Framework (DFF) allows you to write conversational services. The service is written by defining a
special dialog graph that describes the behavior of the dialog service. The dialog graph contains the dialog script.
DFF offers a specialized language (DSL) for quickly writing dialog graphs.
You can use it in services such as writing skills for Amazon Alexa, etc., chatbots for social networks, website call centers, etc.

In this repository, two bots are presented as examples: faq bot and customer service bot. Both bots use Telegram as an interface.
